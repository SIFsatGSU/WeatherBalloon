# WeatherBalloon
The SIF team is providing technical expertise to make way for new experimental possibilities in GSU’s largest science class, Geography 1112, which enrolls over 1500 students annually. As part of SIF’s active learning pedagogy initiatives, designed to support innovatative, dynamic, and active educational techniques at Georgia State University, SIF Fellows are collaborating with faculty from the Department of Geosciences to launch a weather balloon high above the 28 story 25 Park Place Building. This balloon will contain instrumentation allowing students in Geography 1112 to study weather and atmospheric pressure in hands-on, real-world ways and directly engage in scientific observation and experimentation.
